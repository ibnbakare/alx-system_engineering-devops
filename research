Title: Developing a Shopping Cart Web Application using the MERN Stack

Introduction:
Online shopping has become a popular trend, with many consumers preferring to shop online due to its convenience and accessibility. A shopping cart application provides a streamlined and efficient process for managing online purchases. The objective of this research proposal is to develop a web-based shopping cart application using the MERN stack. The proposed application will allow users to browse products, add products to their cart, and complete their purchase.

Team Members:

    John Smith - Project Manager
    Jane Doe - Web Developer (MongoDB, ExpressJS)
    Michael Johnson - UI/UX Designer (ReactJS)
    Alex Lee - Quality Assurance Tester (NodeJS)

Infrastructure:
The proposed shopping cart application will be hosted on a cloud-based infrastructure. The infrastructure will include a web server, database server, and load balancer. Amazon Web Services (AWS) will be used for hosting and managing the infrastructure.

Framework:
The proposed shopping cart application will be developed using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS. The MERN stack is a popular open-source technology stack used for developing web applications.

Risk and Existing Solutions:
The following risks have been identified during the planning phase of the project:

    Security risks - The shopping cart application will handle sensitive user information such as credit card details. To mitigate this risk, SSL encryption will be implemented and user data will be securely stored in a database.
    Performance issues - As the number of users and transactions increase, the shopping cart application may experience performance issues. To mitigate this risk, load testing will be performed to ensure that the application can handle high traffic volumes.
    Compatibility issues - The shopping cart application must be compatible with various web browsers and devices. To mitigate this risk, the application will be tested on various browsers and devices during the development phase.

Branching and Merging Strategies:
The development team will use Git for version control. The branching and merging strategies that will be used are as follows:

    The master branch will contain the stable version of the application.
    The development branch will contain the latest changes that are being worked on by the development team.
    Feature branches will be created for new features and bug fixes.
    Pull requests will be used to review and merge code changes into the development branch.
    Code reviews will be performed before merging changes into the master branch.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the development of a shopping cart web application using the MERN stack will provide users with a streamlined and efficient process for managing their online purchases. The infrastructure will be hosted on a cloud-based platform and will include a web server, database server, and load balancer. The development team will use Git for version control and will follow a branching and merging strategy to manage code changes. The risks associated with the project will be mitigated through the implementation of security measures, load testing, and compatibility testing.
